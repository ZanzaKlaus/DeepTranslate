# DeepTranslate

A simple neural translation model in progress that functions on an encoder-decoder RNN architecture. The goal of this project is to create a neural network that can translate between multiple languages with acceptable accuracy. I plan to create an application that will use the model to translate text on a page, specifically my school's home website. I decided to undertake this endaevor because I wanted to garner experience in programming neural networks.

It is my hope that I will continue to build upon the model's complexity and improve performance.

The model is programmed in python
